# Non-Relational Databases

Course project developed by **Javier Orti** and **Ekaitz Arriola** as part of our university studies on database systems.  
The goal was to explore and compare different **NoSQL paradigms** by building small use cases with three technologies:

- **MongoDB** – Document-oriented storage and querying  
- **Redis** – In-memory key-value store for caching and fast operations  
- **Neo4j** – Graph database for relationship modeling and traversal
